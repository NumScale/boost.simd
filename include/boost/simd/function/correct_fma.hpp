  /*!

    @ingroup group-arithmetic

    Computes fused multiply/add of its parameter.

    @par semantic:
    For any given value @c a, @c b, @c c of type @c T:

    @code
    T r = correct_fma(a, b, c);
    @endcode

    is similar to:

    @code
    T r = a*b+c;
    @endcode

    but with only one rounding

    @par Note:

    For integer a*b+c is performed

    For floating points numbers, always computes the correct fused multiply add,
    this means the computation of a0*a1+a2 with only one rounding operation.
    On machines not possessing this hard wired capability this can be very
    expansive.

    @c correct_fma is in fact a transitory function that allows to ensure
    strict fma capabilities,  i.e. only one rounding operation and no undue
    overflow in intermediate computations.

    If you are using this function for a system with no hard wired fma
    and are sure that overflow is not a problem
    you can define BOOST_SIMD_DONT_CARE_CORRECT_FMA_OVERFLOW to get better
    performances

    This function is never used internally in boost/simd.

    @see  fma



    @return      a value of the same type as the input.
